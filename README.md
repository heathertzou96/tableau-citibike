# Citibike Project

## Background
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

### Task
* Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
* Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total).
* Use visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
* Create a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
* Create a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
* Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
